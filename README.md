# Reconstruction from Fragments

main.cpp is initially set up for evaluating the algorithm, not for reconstruction. 
The path of a BMP file will be passed as the first command line argument, and the location to store the results will be the second command line argument.
Saving results is optional.

To generate an output image, lines 748 and 749 must be uncommented in main.cpp, and an '/images' folder must be created within the same directory as main.cpp.
